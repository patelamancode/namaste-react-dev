Ep-1 :
Injecting react in JS by using CDNs in scripttag

Ep-2:
code before production, we need to optimize code locally:

need to peform -
* code splitting
*Chunking
*compressing
*bundling
*minified code
*compress images and reduce bundle  size

Creating own production ready app just similar as create-react-app :

npm : it is everything  but not a node package manager, it has no full form
         It manage packages, but only stands for node packages.

package.json file is configuration of npm. it creates by initializing npm

What is bundler ? it is imp  package (few are webpack, parcel, Vite)
