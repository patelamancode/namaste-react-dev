Ep-1 :
Injecting react in JS by using CDNs in scripttag

Ep-2:
code before production, we need to optimize code locally:

need to peform -
* code splitting
*Chunking
*compressing
*bundling
*minified code
*compress images and reduce bundle  size

Creating own production ready app just similar as create-react-app :

npm : it is everything  but not a node package manager, it has no full form
         It manage packages, but only stands for node packages.

package.json file is configuration of npm. it creates by initializing npm

What is bundler ? it is imp  package (few are webpack, parcel, Vite)

Diffrence between dev dependency and normal dependency
dev dependency is only used during development of app while normal dependency used in development as well as in production.

*no need to put  that things on github,  which we can regenerate, like node_module
itis created with help of package and package-lock.json  file, So we need to send these 2 files.

Parcel gives super power :
- create dev  build
- create local server (localhost:1234)
- HMR (hot module  replacement) responsible for auto refrese as per change in code.
- It has FIle watching algorithm (written in c++)
- Caching - faster build(so reload time in minimized)
- Image optimization 
- minification
- bundling
- compress
- consistent hasing
- code splitting
- Diffrential Bundling ( to support older browsers )
- Diagnstics : better error handling view
